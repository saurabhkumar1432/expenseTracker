**Last Updated:** January 7, 2026

**Effective Date:** January 7, 2026

## Introduction

Thank you for choosing Expense Tracker ("we", "our", or "the app"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.

Your privacy is important to us. Expense Tracker is designed with a **privacy-first approach** — all your financial data stays on your device.

## Information We Collect

When you use Expense Tracker, you may provide the following information:

| Data Type | Description | Storage Location |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Transactions** | Expense and income amounts, notes, dates | Local device only |
| **Categories** | Custom categories you create | Local device only |
| **Payment Methods** | Payment method names (Cash, UPI, etc.) | Local device only |
| **Budgets** | Monthly budget limits per category | Local device only |
| **Preferences** | Theme preference, filter settings | Local device only |

- ❌ Location data

- ❌ Usage analytics
- ❌ Crash reports (unless explicitly enabled in future updates)
- ❌ Financial account information or bank details

## How Your Data is Stored

### Local Storage Only

All data is stored **exclusively on your device** using Android's SharedPreferences with JSON serialization. This means:

- ✅ Your data never leaves your device
- ✅ No cloud synchronization
- ✅ No server-side storage
- ✅ No internet connection required
- ✅ Complete offline functionality

### Data Persistence

Your data persists on your device until:
- You uninstall the application
- You clear the app's data through Android settings
- You use the in-app data export/delete features (if available)

## Data Sharing

### We Do Not Share Your Data

Expense Tracker does not share, sell, rent, or trade any user data with third parties. Since all data is stored locally on your device, we have no access to it.

### Third-Party Services

The app does not currently integrate with any third-party services that collect user data. This includes:

- ❌ No analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, etc.)
- ❌ No advertising networks
- ❌ No crash reporting services
- ❌ No social media integrations

**Note:** If we integrate third-party services in future updates, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly, and you will be notified through the app update notes.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Data Access and Export

You can access all your data directly within the app. The CSV export feature allows you to export your transactions for personal use or backup.

### Data Deletion

You have full control over your data:

1. **Delete Individual Transactions:** Remove specific entries within the app
2. **Clear All Data:** Use Android Settings → Apps → Expense Tracker → Clear Data
3. **Uninstall App:** Removing the app deletes all associated data

### Data Portability

You can export your transaction data as a CSV file, which can be:
- Opened in spreadsheet applications
- Imported into other financial tools
- Used for personal backup purposes

## Children's Privacy

Expense Tracker is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since the app operates entirely offline with local storage, no data is transmitted that could be associated with any user, including children.

## Security

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data:

- **Local Storage:** All data remains on your device
- **No Network Transmission:** No data is sent over the internet
- **Android Security:** Data is protected by Android's app sandboxing
- **No External Access:** We have no ability to access your data remotely

### Your Responsibilities

- Keep your device secure with a screen lock
- Be cautious when backing up your device to cloud services
- Be aware that clearing app data will permanently delete your transactions

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in:

1. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this document
2. The app's changelog (for significant changes)
3. In-app notification (for major changes affecting data handling)

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Data Retention

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- **Active Use:** Data is retained as long as the app is installed
- **After Uninstall:** All data is permanently deleted
- **No Backups:** We do not maintain any backups of your data

## International Users

Expense Tracker can be used worldwide. Since all data is stored locally on your device, there are no data transfers across borders. Your data remains subject to the local laws and regulations of your jurisdiction.

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using personal information is:

- **Legitimate Interest:** To provide the core functionality of expense tracking
- **Consent:** By using the app, you consent to local storage of the data you provide

Since we don't collect or process personal data on our servers, most GDPR provisions regarding data processors do not apply.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

For California residents, please note:

- We do not sell personal information
- We do not share personal information for behavioral advertising
- All data is stored locally and not accessible to us
